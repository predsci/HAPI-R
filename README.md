# HAPI-R

Dan - put in your notes about the current status of the project at the bottom, but you can also put in some general notes from the other HAPI README files above it.

In the Hapi.r file. The first 450 lines in the Hapi.r are equavilant to the first 390 lines in Hapi.m, the matlab version of Hapi with a few lines of code left not yet converted. The remaining code is the matlab code converted to R with the Mat2r function from the Mat2R library.
